###Soil organic carbon (SOC) is widely studied as a key indicator of soil health. However, its sensitivity to detect management- induced changes has been questioned, and alternative indicators, such as labile or active carbon pools, have been proposed as more responsive indicators. Among them, permanganate-oxidisable carbon (POXC) has gained attention, but there remain critical knowledge gaps regarding its relationship with soil management practices. This database compiles 13,636 comparisons of soil POXC content across various soil uses and managements, extracted from 284 peer-reviewed studies published until the end of year 2023. The dataset spans 45 countries and 63 land use types, covering managed arable land, grassland, agroforestry and forest plantations, and four natural or semi-natural land uses.
